This has got to be the best app created so far. I can't believe it's free! This gives you the ability to create pages the way you want. I can't believe that Shopify hasn't built this app years ago. This is exactly what I've been looking for. There are page elements that should be available to all stores without having to pay monthly fees to use. Like photo scrolling animation. And parallax sections. I've only been trying it out for one day and I am blown away by all the options. I'm moving my store from Weebly to Shopify, and was disappointed by the lack of being able to build a page from scratch with the latest and greatest functions. This app is a total game changer! Thank you for creating this app. I would recommend this app to EVERY Shopify user.

It is a solid page builder that just keeps getting better and better!\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n-Super flexible\r\n-Allows me to create pretty much any page I can imagine\r\n-Built-in Shopify-product modules save a ton of time\r\n-Built-in laptop/tablet/mobile views make optimized page building simple\r\n-Customer service is extremely responsive and helpful (even when I'm the one who is making the mistake, not the app)\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n-There is a glitch that makes it impossible to make edits from within laptop view\r\n-Sometimes the \"hide-in\" feature doesn't work on laptops\r\n-The nesting architecture of PageFly can be a little challenging to get used to. More on this below.\r\n-Occasionally the screen suddenly goes blank and I lose my progress if I haven't saved the page recently. It could be just me, but save often just to be safe.\r\n-There aren't a lot of customization options for the Shopify-product module quite yet. I'd like to be able to change the size of the product image, change the color of the product title, etc.\r\n\r\nRegarding the nesting architecture: It can take some time to get used to the section/row/column/element nesting structure of PageFly. This set up makes a lot of sense from a coding perspective, but may not be intuitive for someone without any html or coding experience. Sections are the outermost container, rows are nested within sections, columns are nested within rows, and elements are nested within columns. \r\n\r\nThis means that if you have a paragraph of text showing in the editor, it is actually 4 levels deep and found within a column, a row, and a section. This matters because when you are making changes to font colors, backgrounds, and other aspects, you want to ensure you are editing the right level. Otherwise you might get frustrated trying to figure out why your changes don't seem to be creating the effect you expected.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nEven though this app still has a lot of work to become polished and more powerful, I gave it 5 stars because of the hypercustomizability it provides and because of the awesome customer support. I've used several page builders, some very expensive, and none of them allow me to create pages that look as good as the ones PageFly lets me create. I love it!","created_at":"2017-10-04T02:21:08.000-04:00","shop_domain":"soulistic-essential-oils.myshopify.com","shop_name":"Soulistic Essential Oils","star_rating":5}]}
